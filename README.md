![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onlylemi/res/master/download-any-for-github-icon.png)

It's a chrome extension. When we look up some resources in `GitHub`, and usually we need to look them in local. At this time we must use `git clone`, `Download ZIP` or `Open in Desktop`. But sometimes we don't need to download the whole repository and only to look some folders or some files. So this chrome extension can help you achieve your demand.

It can download any files or folders in repository in GitHub.
